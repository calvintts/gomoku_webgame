        <ul>Rules
          <li>Besides many variations around the world, the Swap2 rule (based on "swap" from Renju) is currently adapted in tournaments among professional players, including Gomoku World Championships.</li>
          <li>In Swap2 rule, the first player places 3 stones (2 black 1 white, if black goes first) on the board, the second player has the choice to take black/white or to place 2 more stones to change the shape and let the first player choose color.[3] This is essentially a slightly more elaborate pie rule.
</li>
          <li>Swap2 solved the low complexity problem[4] and makes the game fairer. Like other rules and variations, 100% fairness can be reached by playing two alternating games for each point.</li>
